Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center of Humans and Machines from Max Planck Institute for Human Development

My research interests includes:

Moral psychology
======
(social-psychological determinants of transgressive behavior and moral judgment)
-e.g., moral licensing, dyadic morality (agency and experience), mind perception, moralistic punishment

Social hierarchy
======
 (interpersonal perception and interaction within power/status stratification)
-e.g., Social class, power/status and interpersonal dynamics (morality/prosociality/cooperation)

Existential psychology
======
(fundamental needs of meaning-making, control, and order)
-e.g., terror management, uncertainty management, compensatory control, religious beliefs
